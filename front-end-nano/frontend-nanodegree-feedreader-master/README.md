### Feed Reader Testing Project for the Fron End Nanodegree Program with Udacity


# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The website consists of a Udacity Blog that has linked to important and relevant articles about career success! In this blog there is a drop down menu on the left that directs you to CSS Tricks, HTML5 Rocks, Linear Digressions. 

# The Job

My task for this project is to implement tests using a JavaScript Testing Framwork called Jasmine. 

# Get the Project
